This question is quite straightforward. Let \\(S = \\sum{\\textit{marks}}\\) and \\(n\\) denotes the size of \\(\textit{marks}\\). The goal is to find the minimum \\(r\\) which satisfies the condition \\(\frac{10 r + S}{r + n} \ge 9.5\\). Simple brute force with simulation is the easiest way to compute it, but the computation can be very time consuming if the average of the initial set of marks, i.e., \\(\frac{S}{n}\\) is very low, and it may lead to the problems of comparing floating point numbers. Interestingly, applying simple rearrangement of the previous equation shows that \\(r \ge 19 n - 2 S\\). As we need to find a minimum \\(r\\), letting \\(r = 19 n - 2 S\\) can yield the correct result. This expression can eliminate the unnecessary simulation step.
