This is a simple question which can be done in one pass. Probably the most tricky thing is the comparison of floating point values, but this is not the major focus of this question, and the result indeed reflects that using primitive instruction for comparisons is accepted. Let \\(n\\) be the length of the input and \\(k\\) be the average length of each strings, then the time complexity will be \\(\Theta(k n)\\).
