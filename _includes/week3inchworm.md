Finding the solution by simulation is a simple but inefficient solution. Let \\(B\\) denotes the branch length, then it requires \\(O(B)\\) to complete the simulation. A smarter way to solve this problem is to first find the least common multiplier of `rest`, denoted as \\(R\\), and `leaf`, denoted as \\(L\\), which is the interval where the worm is able to eat the leaf and have a rest. Then it is easy to determine how many intervals the branch has. Finding least common multiplier is easy by computing the greatest common divider with Euclidean Algorithm, which has a time complexity of \\(O(\log{R} + \log{L})\\).
