Another typical bruteforce problem. Counting the number of factors of a number \\(n\\) requires \\(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\\). Generating the number \\(n\\) from the given permutation of the digits needs \\(\Theta(\log_{10}{n})\\) or \\(\Theta(s)\\) where \\(s\\) is the size of ``digits``, and obviously \\(s = \Theta(\log_{10}{n})\\). Generating permutations of the digits requires \\(\Theta(s \cdot s!)\\) by [Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Trotter_algorithm). Recursion can solve this in \\(\Theta(s!)\\) with extra space of \\(\Theta(s)\\). Another interesting algorithm, [Heap's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap%27s_algorithm), can achieve similar time complexity (\\(\Theta(s!)\\)) at the expense of \\(\Theta(s)\\) space as well but in an iterative form.
